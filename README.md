# WetHeatWarnings

Uses R to visualize a weather data base to predict the Wet Bulb Temperatures for over 8000 cities. This has a critical application in the modern world, since climate change is quickly making many cities unlivable due to rising heat and humidity levels. Humans cannot survive in >95F wet bulb temperature for more than a few hours, since the body cannot sweat efficiently enough at that point to lose heat. Studies show that wet bulb temperatures as low as 79 degrees can begin to harm humans, 89 degrees can make physical labor dangerous, and temperatures about 95 degrees may require evacuation. This web app map uses data science to track the cities at risk.
